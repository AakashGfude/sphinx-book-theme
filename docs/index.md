# The Sphinx Book Theme

A book-like theme for Sphinx.

This is a lightweight Sphinx theme, primarily made for use by [Jupyter Book](https://beta.jupyterbook.org).
It tries to keep a simplified style and visual layout in a book-like theme.

It relies on [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/)
via the [PyData Sphinx Theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/) for its base
structure and configuration.
